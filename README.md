Data Structures and Algorithms
(Elective) Year 2, Sem 1

CA1 required us to create a seat booking system with three modes: Normal, Safe-distance, Smart Safe-distance. Not only did we have to create these three modes, we also had to make sure the state of the form can be stored in and loaded from a binary file. CA1 needed us to use DLL. I opted for matrix DLL because I felt that it was easier to implement. CA2 required us to create a project manager application with three forms: Role form, Employee form, Project form. Similar to the CA1, all the data should also be able to be stored in and loaded from a binary file. CA2 needed us to use tree data structures.

These programs operate using Windows Forms and can be launched through Visual Studio.
